Hi! 
You've found my progress on a RNG Manipulation for 
Pokemon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness.

I've made some great progress which you are more
than welcome to browse. I am happy to answer any questions
on anything here. I'd really appreciate any feedback on my code, or 
if you have found some information that you feel could help the project.
 
For more info on my progress, please see this pastebin: https://pastebin.com/NuC46x6y.
or for periodic snapshots you can follow my Twitter at: https://twitter.com/KapitalSR.
This will take many, many months of work, especially as I balance University and work.
Please be patient, I'm working on it!

:)
