Aldelaro has said in the past that he believes the background pattern to be based on whether or not the lab is loaded on that frame.
However, I've also heard that the fountains in phenac also call rng rapidly. Given that there are fountains in Xd's scene too, I suspect
that it is actually them that forces the calls.
However, it is not purely based on this. Roughly ever 120ish frames, the point value of the seed is called on and influences the transition to the next pattern.
It appears that different seeds cause different lengths of patterns. Even the specific transition between patterns will be reversed.
By chance, some sections may not deviate. Yet to prove if all pattern changes check the current rng value.





Bascially 5 objects are passed via an array of pointers into green. Some physics happens then passes them into purple.
Purple then has some conditions and checks before it passes the current object into blue for the loop.



13 unique calls for RNG on any cycle.
Purple Func. 801335e0 - roughly 4-6 times per frame.

Red Func. x2 + 2 80134610
Blue Func. x5 + 13? -^ goes back to the red function again.

Occurs after the final object is accounted for, somewhere in the between frame period.

Biggest issues summary:

1. The 3 intervals after input variance, and why they occur.
2. The 3 main patterns (sevens, eights and As) an why they change
3. The impact of the seed on the length of the patterns (why sometimes the pattern lasts 120f vs 125+ frames).
    ^This isn't totally determined by rng. Two examples of leading 7s can have different pattern lengths again. 
    Sometimes this is massive, at every 123ish frame intervals.
    Could sack frames to avoid shooting for a frame that isn't valid. 
    However this will reduce the possible teddies and the overall effectiveness of the manip.
    On the other hand, including them will increase the teddy count  (and therefore the time spent waiting)
    at the cost of an "igt failure" so to speak.

1. Begins at low 12 pattern, then increments up to pattern 20 before resetting down to pattern 12 again.
at 4 frame intervals. 


CAN IGT TRACK TO SOLVE FOR PATTERN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Basically will start movement on a particular second(?)/interval (half second? less?) on the livesplit timer and that will guarantee a pattern.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Pattern appears to cycle fully every 2 seconds, since each averages out to a half second.

or just do it on the fly and be extremely observant? Livesplit tracking less work lmao.


When loading in, the seed at the time is used to determine a starting point for animations in the scene.
-- observed variances: 
First 3 rng calling objects are the fountains. 

2 & 3 are partially explained by the movement in the flappy bits of the cipher guards but not fully.
